title: Introduction to Firmament
---

*Firmament* is the name of our many-partied west marches style game running in the Tabletop Gaming discord server. The goal of this game is to maintain a social game, composed of many different players to make it easier to play Dungeons and Dragons as people want to.

**Basic Principles**
1. Players
	1. are encouraged to jump in and out of play week-to-week
	2. are required to decide where to go, with the game master building the adventure in the direction the players go to (Player Driven / DM Reactive)
	3. are expected to maintain their own character sheets
	4. sharing information between players should be **strongly** encouraged; offering some reward to players who update shared resources like a map, or shared lore
	5. should come ready to play in a session, with a character sheet made
2. Game Masters
	3. volunteer to run sessions when they want to
	4. create the content players move to
	5. should not correct players, or shared resources 
	6. should not look at content in this document that is related to an adventure they are currently a player for
	7. should track in-world time of their adventures to ensure players are staying roughly in line with each other in time.
		1. for players who join in sessions more than once a week, multiple characters are encouraged  to avoid weird shenanigans being in multiple places at once
	8. should always respect player agency, and not override player decision or dictate a choice for a player
	9. should roll in the open
3. Sessions
	1. should use standard rules, or have variants clearly mentioned before the game
	2. should have between 3 and 5 players
	3. can be composed of parties of varying levels, it is up to the players to make wise choices or look out for each other in game
4. Adventures
	1. are composed of multiple sessions, with a recommended length of 2-5 sessions total
	2. should be mostly self-containing, or reference other material the game master has been involved in
	3. should not resolve conflicts or plot points in other game masters adventures


**Game Balance**
1. Experience
	1. In the interest of advancing players in a reasonably balanced way, we should use experience points based on CR, along with reasonable experience for passing challenges like puzzles, traps, or avoiding encounters.
	2. should not be reduced as a penalty or a game mechanic
2. Loot
	1. loot should be meted out with reason. 
	2. adventures are encouraged to contain heroically difficult challenges that result in a treasure hoard to encourage players to discuss what they couldn't get done, and drive further adventures
3. Time
	1. Time keeping is required for GMs running an adventure, to ensure that the players involved in the adventure are not simultaneously doing other things / rapidly becoming overpowered.
	2. Each week that at least one adventure takes place, will move the overall game clock forward one week of in-game time. Where experienced time (number of active days / long rests in session) and passed time differ, players are invited to expand on what their characters are doing in down time.
	3. An adventure that advances past 7 long rests will require the characters to not be active during the next week of active games.
4. Death
	1. player death will occur. It should be very possible to over commit or face off against a stronger challenge and die
	2. resurrection should be done at the expense of the resurrection spell, or resulting from a significant adventure.
	3. should not be performed by game master fiat, for example, by divine intervention
5. Gods
	1. without significant discussion with other game masters, gods should be treated as immaterial, and likely unreachable much less killable.
6. Encumbrance
	1. unless there is a narratively useful reason, we should mostly ignore encumbrance. I.e., carrying that extra blade out though their pack is pretty well loaded? no big deal. Carrying the entire dragons hoard? No.
7. Creating New Magic Items
	1. reskins are perfectly fine, so long as the mechanics aren't changed
	2. introducing or changing mechanics should be checked with at least one other game master to avoid shifting power dynamics

**Setting up a Session**
1. If you are interested in running a session, post in the Firmament discord channel to see if there are players interested in going somewhere. Post the following information
	1. When you are available to run a session
	2. Any variant rules you use at your table
	3. Whether the game will be in person, or in discord
2. If you are a player looking for groups, request a group in the Firmament discord channel with 

**Session Requirements**
1. Games must have between 3 and 5 players to run an adventure, to ensure the game remain cooperative 
2. Standard Dungeons and Dragons rules, any session-specific rules should be included in the description of the game when scheduling
3. Sessions should be populated first come / first serve from the discord channel, unless 

**New Players**
1. New characters should begin at level 11, encouraging high-level but varied level parties over time
2. New characters should buy their own gear based on the formula `(1d12 + 1 x 750g)`
	1. it is considered reasonable to purchase gear in the rare category. Very rare, and legendary cannot be purchased and must be found.
3. Characters entering into the Firmament are, by definition, recently dead. Consider writing how exactly you died.
